          I was born in 1994, in Washington D.C. When I turned 4, my family moved to Dahka, Bangladesh. After living there for four years, my family again move this time to Almaty Kazakhstan.  I learned how to speak Russian there, a skill I retain to this day. However, my family was not done moving and at the age of 10 I moved to Israel where I would live until highschool.  I decided to go back to my homeland for highschool and enrolled in Phillips Exeter Academy.  It was there I first learned anything about programming a love that has not left me.  Today I study Computer Science at Wesleyan University.  It my dream to become a software engineer after I graduate, and I'm working toward that goal every day, just checkout my resume.
